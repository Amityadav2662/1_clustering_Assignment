    "1. K-means: Like sorting by color. It picks a fixed number of \"piles\" (clusters) and assigns socks (data points) to the \n",
    "closest pile based on features (color, size). Simple but can struggle with odd shapes (data).\n",
    "2. Hierarchical: Like sorting by color, then material, then size. It builds a \"family tree\" of clusters, starting with\n",
    "all socks together and splitting them based on features until individual socks are left. Good for exploring data \n",
    "structure but can be slow for large piles.\n",
    "3. Density-based: Like sorting by where socks are clumped on the floor. It groups socks close together and leaves outliers \n",
    "alone. Useful for data with uneven density or noise.\n",
    "4. Distribution-based: Like sorting by assuming socks come from different boxes (distributions). It uses fancy math to fit\n",
    "socks into different \"boxes\" based on their features. Powerful but needs more data and fine-tuning."
